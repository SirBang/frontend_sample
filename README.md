**Deadline: Sat  Nov 18 @ 12pm GMT**

**Frontend sample work project for ContractHound**

* Please fork this project. Please do not issue a PR on this repository.
* Made your changes in your fork and then give me access to the fork

Please follow these rules:

* The only file to be edited is index.html. I have included some of the JS and CSS files used to render the page. You should not need to edit these.
* You should not add any more JS or CSS files
* You may use from the iconset we are using, which are the free icons from fontawesome <i style="fa fa-iconname"> will give you a font to work with
* There are two "markers" in index.html on lines 352 and 458. Please only make changes between those lines
* You may use any of the builtin bootstrap classes or any of the marked up creative-tim.com classes

The goal is to understand if you can improve the layout, design & and organisation of the page with little to no guidance using stock classes from Bootstrap & the Creative-tim theme.

**Goal** 

The page currently looks like this:

<img width="1946" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 15 19 33" src="https://github.com/pjr/frontend-sample/assets/46494/28a746e0-80d1-439e-9a1f-04081256b712">

The goal is to improve the UI/UX of the current form using the components at your disposal. There is no need to make changes to the menubar on the left or the search bar at the top. 

The markers highlighted above demonstrate where you should be editing on the page.

Please reach out to phil@growlabs.io if
* something doesn't work
* you're not sure if you can use something
